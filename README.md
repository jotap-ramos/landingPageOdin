# landingPageOdin
This is a version of the Odin Project's landing Page assignment with free pics. 
It was made just for learning purposes.
Thanks to:
Cottonbro Studio for the theater curtain image;
Pavel Danilyuk for the cinema chairs image;
Markus Spiske for the film roll image (edited).
DALL-E 3 for the free AI generated images of our frog friend.
Your free-to-use pictures have made possible to create a much more interesting landingPage.
